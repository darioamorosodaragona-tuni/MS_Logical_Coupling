# MS_Logical_Coupling_Online_Appendix
Online Appendix of the paper Microservices Logical Coupling submitted to ICSA 2023 NEMI track. 

The folder "dataset" contains the dataset used for this work. 
The "scripts" folder contains all the scripts and the all the files used to perform the analysis. 
In particular each sub folder represent a step of the analysis and in each of these there is an "input" folder and an "output" folder, the first one contains all the files used as input for the script and the latter one contains all the files produced by the script.
Each step uses as input the output of the previous step.

The equal number on the folder name means that the folder are not subsequent steps, but each of these uses the output file of the previous step.

The folders that contain the results that are on the paper are marked with the respective Research Question, thus in that folder it is possible to find, in the "output" folder, the figures inserted on the paper.
